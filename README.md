# 🧠 ML Internship Projects

This repository contains 3 end-to-end machine learning projects developed during my internship, covering computer vision, clinical prediction, and financial fraud detection. Each project is built with modular pipelines, explainable modeling, and interactive dashboards for deployment and teaching.
